\section{Abstract}

Reputation in centralized systems typically uses stars and review-based
trust. These systems require extensive manual intervention and secrecy to
avoid manipulation. In decentralized systems this luxury is not available
as the reputation system should be autonomous and open source. Previous
peer-to-peer reputation systems define trust abstractly and do not allow for
financial arguments pertaining to reputation. We propose a concrete
sybil-resilient decentralized reputation system in which direct trust is
defined as lines-of-credit using bitcoin's 1-of-2 multisig. We introduce a new
model for bitcoin wallets in which user coins are split among trusted friends.
Indirect trust is subsequently defined using a transitive property. This
enables formal game theoretic arguments pertaining to risk analysis. Using our
reputation model, we prove that risk and max flows are equivalent and propose
several algorithms for the redistribution of trust so that a decision can be
made on whether an anonymous third party can be indirectly trusted. In such a
setting, the risk incurred by making a purchase from an anonymous vendor
remains invariant. Finally, we prove the correctness of our algorithms and
provide optimality arguments for various norms.
