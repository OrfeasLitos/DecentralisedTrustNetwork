    We use $prev\left(j\right)$ and $next\left(j\right)$ to denote the previous and next turn respectively played by
    $Player(j)$.

  \noindent Knowledge of the initial graph $\mathcal{G}_0$, all players' initial capital and the history amount to full
  comprehension of the evolution of the game. Building on the example of Fig.~\ref{fig:utxo}, we can see the resulting graph
  when $D$ plays
  \begin{equation}
  \label{turnexample}
     Turn_1 = \{Steal\left(1, A\right), Add\left(4, C\right), Add\left(-1, B\right)\} \enspace.
  \end{equation}

  \noindent Trust Is Risk is controlled by an environment that chooses a player, receives the turn that this player wishes to
  play and, if this turn is valid, executes it. These steps are repeated indefinitely. We assume players are chosen in a way
  that, after her turn, a player will eventually play again later.

  \noindent \texttt{strategy[}$A$\texttt{]()} provides player $A$ with full knowledge of the game, except for the capitals of
  other players. This assumption may not be always realistic.

  \texttt{executeTurn()} checks the validity of \texttt{Turn} and substitutes it with an empty turn if invalid.
  Subsequently, it creates the new graph $\mathcal{G}_j$ and updates the history accordingly. For the routine code,
  see Appendix B\ifdefined\proceedings \ in the full version of Trust Is Risk \cite{trustisrisk}\fi.
