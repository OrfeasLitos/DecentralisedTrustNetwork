  \section{The Trust Graph}
     We now engage in the formal description of the proposed system, accompanied by helpful examples.
     \begin{definition}[Graph]
        TrustIsRisk is represented by a sequence of directed weighted graphs $\left(\mathcal{G}_j\right)$ where $\mathcal{G}_j
        = \left(\mathcal{V}_j, \mathcal{E}_j\right), j \in \mathbb{N}$.
        Also, since the graphs are weighted, there exists a sequence of weight functions $\left(c_j\right)$ with $c_j :
        \mathcal{E}_j \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^{+}$.
     \end{definition}
     The nodes represent the players, the edges represent the existing direct trusts and the weights represent the amount of
     value attached to the corresponding direct trust. As we will see, the game evolves in turns. The subscript of the graph
     represents the corresponding turn.
     \begin{definition}[Players]
        The set $\mathcal{V}_j = \mathcal{V}\left(\mathcal{G}_j\right)$ is the set of all players in the network, otherwise
        understood as the set of all pseudonymous identities.
     \end{definition}
     Each node has a corresponding non-negative number that represents its capital. A node's capital is the total value that
     the node possesses exclusively and nobody else can spend.
     \begin{definition}[Capital]
        The initial capital of $A$, $Cap_{A, 0}$, is defined as the total value that belongs to $A$ and exists in P2PKH in
        the UTXO at the beginning of the game.
     \end{definition}
     The capital of $A$ is subsequently modified only during her turns, according to her actions. We also note that a
     player's assets are the sum of her capital and her total outgoing trust.

     The formal definition of direct trust follows:
     \begin{definition}[Direct Trust]
        Direct trust from $A$ to $B$ at the end of turn $j$, $DTr_{A \rightarrow B, j}$, is defined as the total amount of
        value that exists in 1/$\{A,B\}$ multisigs in the UTXO in the end of turn $j$, where the money is deposited by $A$.
        \begin{equation}
           DTr_{A \rightarrow B, j} =
              \begin{cases}
                 c_j\left(A, B\right), & if \left(A, B\right) \in \mathcal{E}_j \\
                 0, & else
              \end{cases}
        \end{equation}
     \end{definition}
     This definition agrees with the title of this paper and coincides with the intuition and experimental results of
     \cite{kmrs} that the trust $Alice$ shows to $Bob$ in real-world social networks corresponds with the extent
     of danger in which $Alice$ is ready to expose herself to in order to help $Bob$. An example graph with its corresponding
     transactions in the UTXO can be seen below.

     Any algorithm that has access to the graph $\mathcal{G}_j$ has implicitly access to all direct trusts of this graph.
     We use the notation $N^{+}(A)$ to refer to the nodes directly trusted by $A$ and $N^{-}(A)$ for the nodes that directly
     trust $A$. We also use the notation $in_{A, j}, out_{A, j}$ to refer to the total incoming and outgoing direct trust
     respectively. For a reference of common definitions, see the Appendix.
