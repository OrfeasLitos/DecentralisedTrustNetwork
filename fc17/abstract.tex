   Reputation in centralized systems uses stars and review-based trust. Such systems require manual intervention and
   algorithm secrecy to avoid manipulation. In autonomous and open source decentralized systems this luxury is not available.
   Previous peer-to-peer reputation systems do not allow for financial arguments pertaining to reputation. We propose a
   concrete Sybil-resilient decentralized reputation system where direct trust is defined as lines-of-credit using
   bitcoin's 1-of-2 multisig. We introduce a new model for bitcoin wallets in which user coins are split among trusted
   associates. Indirect trust is subsequently defined transitively. This enables formal game theoretic arguments pertaining
   to risk analysis. We prove that risk and max flows are equivalent in our model. Our system allows for concrete financial
   decisions on the monetary amount a pseudonymous party can be trusted with. Through algorithmic trust redistribution, the
   risk incurred from making a purchase from a pseudonymous party in this manner remains invariant.
