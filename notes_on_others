Bitcoin
Does not involve trust to anybody, but trust to the correctness of the algorithm, outside our scope

PGP pathfinder (pgp.cs.uu.nl)
i)	PGP signatures model meeting in person and verifying that a particular public key belongs to a particular person
ii)	PGP pathfinder does not quantify trust because anyone on the chain could be a liar or mistaken
iii)	This is inherently a binary (a.k.a simple) trust setting, still not satisfactorily solved

open reputation (not actively developed)
Decentralized Internet-of-Things reputation
i)	Virtues: simple or complex general measures of reputation (e.g. honest->[0,100], "authored by"->{0,1})
ii)	Reputes: specific measures of reputation (e.g John's "honest" repute is in Jack's opinion 94)
iii)	Reputer: Agent (user, web app, IOT sensor) attributing reputation to another object, also including this attribution to the reputer's reputation.
iv)	Reputee: Object (not necessarily agent) accepting (or not) a reputation given out by a reputer
v)	Reputery: intermediate between reputer and reputee (e.g. web service allowing users to rate an online shop)
vi)	Unclear definitions of direct and indirect reputation
vii)	Public (blockchain) ledger for identities, reputations and relations

A Computational Model of Trust and Reputation - Mui
i)	Discussion of reputation & trust as distinct things
ii)	computational model based on social and scientific disciplines
iii)	Uses concept of social reciprocity (be nice to nice people and bad to bad ones)
iv)	reputation->trust->reciprocity->reputation->... (trust-/>reputation directly)
v)	Static network (no new/leaving nodes), binary actions (defect, cooperate)
vi)	The higher the trust level of a_j for agent a_i , the higher the expectation that a_i will reciprocate agent a_j ’s actions. That is a special-case trust.
vii)	The math is simple statistics: if the other has been reciprocal p/n times, that is the expected reciprocity next time.
viii)	Encounters are only pairwise, reciprocity increases only when both choose the same action in the same encounter.
ix)	Reliability to intermediary nodes is augmented with each encounter, whether bad or good.

An integrated trust and reputation model for open multi-agent systems, FIRE - Dong Huynh (not completely read, up to 12)
i)	Open, decentralized, no global knowledge
ii)	Reputation is societal trust
iii)	No use of digital signatures. Explicitly avoids considering lying, inaccuracy and withholding of information.
v)	Context-aware [-1,+1] ratings
vi)	Trust for each of 4 sources of trust (personal experience, witnesses, role-based rules, certificates target provides) is calculated using weighted average.
vii)	Several hand-tuned parameters and arbitrary (but sensible) function choices

A Generic Framework for Modeling Decentralized Reputation-based Trust Models
i)	4C: Content, Communication, Computation, Counteraction
ii)	Subject (reputation evaluator of the target peer), Target, Recommender (informs subject peer): A subject asks a recommender how good a target is. Recommenders' recommendations are considered according to their reputation
iii)	Trust is a number. It is generated by combining personal experience with peer P and the peer's reputation R.
iv)	Reputation is a set of binary, discrete or continuous values that is context-aware and may expire.
v)	Peers may belong to groups, there may be group hierarchy and multiple participation. Group reputation is also possible.
vi)	Context of trust is considered, with sub-contexts as well.
vii)	Communication protocols: initiated by subject or target. Hop counts are considered.
viii)	"Degree of trust in unknowns", "Recent interaction weight", "Trust Threshold", Trust Value = w*P + (1-w)*R (limiting)
ix)	Has an editor that produces an XML description of the trust model as output
x)	No privacy considerations, trust and reputation are not clearly distinguished, cryptography is not used, peer hierarchy not present, offline peers implicitly ignored

Bazaar
Centralized marketplace (EBay server-side add-on) with a risk network
i) 	centralized because it needs full network knowledge by the trusted authority to calculate maxFlow
ii)	Direct trust (DT(A, B)) is a non-directional wheighted edge
iii)	Indirect trust (IT(A, B)) is the maxFlow
	a)	IT(A, B) = IT(B, A)
	b)	IT > DT
iv)	User (customer) input: positive/neutral/negative feedback
v)	Bazaar-NDSI.pdf, Figure	2 for mechanics

Beaver
Decentralized marketplace with star&review-based reputation (non Sybil attackable)
i)	3 actors: customers, vendors, miners
ii)	Untraceable public reviews (protecting customers)
iii)	Specific marketplace orientation (cannot implement things like popcorn)
iv)	Public ledger with complete history - trust highly subjective
v)	Sybil attacks mitigated with (arbitarily tuned) cost-of-registration and cost-of-product listing for vendors and one review per transaction
vi)	beaver.pdf, Figure 2 for details

Byzantine protocols
i)	Wide variety
ii)	Used to reach distributed consensus on reasonably objective things (file contents etc)

Synereo
Decentralized "facebook"
i)	Attention economy
ii)	Concept of "current" with which each post flows from node to node
iii)	No direct concept of trust - nobody can make you lose anything except for time
iv)	Engagement function of (e.g given in paper) read, like, share (not directly of time spent engaging content)
v)	current(gk, e, H) = charge(H, content(e)) ∗ AMPs(e) ∗ engagement(s, t, H) ∗ Reo(s, t, H) where gk node behavior, e event, H history, s source, t target, AMPs conserved currency (user adjustable), Reo mean engagement
vi)	posts are ordered based on current
vii)	Somewhat cryptic paper (and dubious expressions: 'Step forward and kneel young organizing principle, we dub thee Ceptron. Go forth and organize online experiences for the good of all peoples everywhere.')
