A simple version of the game is used: The game graph has a random initial configuration where every player has a random direct
trust towards every other player, as well as a random capital. These values may be uniformly distributed in an interval or may
follow another distribution such as the exponential, or may have a high probability of being zero. The exact distribution
however is not determined at this point, as it is not yet needed.

The players also know that after R rounds (blocks in bitcoin terms) exactly two players are selected at random (these choices
follow the uniform distribution). One is dubbed seller and the other buyer. The seller offers a good that costs C (this number
is common knowledge from the beginning), which she values at C - l and the buyer values at C + l (l is also common knowledge
from the beginning).

The players play simultaneously in each round and can do any of the known actions. If two actions collide (e.g. A reduces
$DTr_{A \rightarrow B}$ and B steals from $DTr_{A \rightarrow B}$ as well, then one of the two actions is chosen with equal
probability (50\%).

To better model a player's actions and the aforementioned conflict resolution, we demand that each change explicitly mentions
the source and the destination of the funds for each of her actions. For example, player $A$ decides on the values of all the
following variables. This constitutes a concrete round for $A$.

\begin{align}
  \forall B, C \in \mathcal{V}, B \neq C, move\left(A, \left(A, B\right), \left(A, C\right) \right) = ? \\
  \forall B, C \in \mathcal{V}, B \notin \{A, C\}, move\left(A, \left(B, A\right), \left(A, C\right) \right) = ?
\end{align}
The first argument is the player who decides, the second argument is from which direct trust to take the funds and the third
is to which direct trust to deposit the funds.

Now for the constraints for player's $A$ move.

\begin{enumerate}
  \item It makes no sense to deposit to and withdraw from a specific direct trust in the same round. This constraint applies
  only to outgoing direct trusts, because incoming direct trusts cannot be increased.
  \begin{align}
    \forall B, C, D \in \mathcal{V}, move\left(A, \left(A, B\right), \left(A, C\right) \right) move\left(A, \left(A, D\right),
    \left(A, B\right) \right) = 0 \\
    \wedge \\
    \forall B, C, D \in \mathcal{V}, move\left(A, \left(A, B\right), \left(A, C\right) \right) move\left(A, \left(D, A\right),
    \left(A, B\right) \right) = 0
  \end{align}

  \item One cannot use more funds than are available from a single direct trust.
  \begin{align}
    \forall B \in \mathcal{V}, \sum\limits_{C \in \mathcal{V}} move\left(A, \left(A, B\right), \left(A, C\right) \right)
      \leq DTr_{A \rightarrow B} \\
    \forall B \in \mathcal{V}, \sum\limits_{C \in \mathcal{V}} move\left(A, \left(B, A\right), \left(A, C\right) \right)
      \leq DTr_{B \rightarrow A} \\
  \end{align}

  \item The total funds before and after the move must be equal.
  \begin{align}
    \sum\limits_{B \in \mathcal{V}\\
    = \\

  \end{align}
\end{enumerate}
