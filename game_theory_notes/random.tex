\subsection{Random Roles}
  All players follow the same strategy. After $R$ rounds (blocks in bitcoin terms) exactly two players are selected at random
  (these choices follow the uniform distribution). One is dubbed seller and the other buyer. The seller offers a good that
  costs $C$, which she values at $C - l$ and the buyer values at $C + l$. The values $R, C$ and $l$, as well as the
  uniform distribution with which the buyer and seller are chosen, are common knowledge from the beginning of the game.
