\section{Strategy Generalization}
  More specifically, apart from the capacity $c_e$, each edge $e$ is assigned a gain factor $\gamma_e \in \left[0, 1\right]$.
  [Definition of new conservative strategy]
  The MaxFlow algorithm is substituted with the generalized MaxFlow algorithm [proof needed].
  For the sake of example, consider the following two graphs:
  
  \subimport{generalizedMaxFlow/figures/}{simple1.tikz}

  \subimport{generalizedMaxFlow/figures/}{simple2.tikz}

  A gain factor of 0 means that $v$ will tolerate any amount of stolen funds by $w$ without trying to replenish them by stealing
  others that directly trust her, whereas a gain factor of 1 means that $v$ will try to replenish any amount of stolen funds by
  $w$. If the gain factor is 0 on edges $\left(v, w\right)$ for all $w \in \mathcal{V}$, then $v$ is following the Idle
  strategy, whereas if the gain factor is 1 on edges $\left(v, w\right)$ for all $w \in \mathcal{V}$, then $v$ is following the
  Conservative strategy. The incoming direct trusts to the Evil player should all have a gain factor equal to 1, since we
  consider that she steals all her incoming direct trust.
