The generalized MaxFlow algorithm expects as input a graph with capacities as well as a \textit{gain factor} for each edge,
which in our case will be a number in $\left[0, 1\right]$. Intuitively, the gain factor of an edge $\left(v, w\right)$
represents the ratio of "leakage" this edge causes. In our case, it represents the percentage of funds that $v$ will try to
replenish when $w$ steals from her. For the sake of example, consider the following graph:

%\begin{tikzpicture}[>=latex']
%\begin{dot2tex}[dot,tikz]
%digraph G {
%  rankdir=LR
%  labelloc="b"
%  label="Fig.1:\\ Alice\\ trusts\\ Charlie\\ 10"
%  Alice -> Bob [label="c=10, g=0.6"]
%  Bob -> Charlie [label="c=20, g=0.4"]
%}
%\end{dot2tex}
%\end{tikzpicture}

%\import{generalizedMaxFlow/figures/}{simpleexample.tikz}

A gain factor of 0 means that $v$ will tolerate any amount of stolen funds by $w$ without trying to replenish them by stealing
others that directly trust her, whereas a gain factor of 1 means that $v$ will try to replenish any amount of stolen funds by
$w$. If the gain factor is 0 on edges $\left(v, w\right)$ for all $w \in \mathcal{V}$, then $v$ is following the Idle
strategy, whereas if the gain factor is 1 on edges $\left(v, w\right)$ for all $w \in \mathcal{V}$, then $v$ is following the
Conservative strategy.
