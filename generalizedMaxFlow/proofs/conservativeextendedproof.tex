\begin{proof}
  The definition of the Conservative strategy could be equivalently rewritten as follows: Player $A$ follows the Conservative
  strategy if she attempts to replenish the value $Dmg_A$ she lost since the previous turn by stealing from each player $v \in
  N^{-}\left(A\right)_{j-1}$ value $y_v\bitcoin$ in a way which ensures that
  \begin{equation*}
    \sum\limits_{v \in N\left(A\right)_{j-1}}y_v = Dmg_A \wedge \forall v \in N\left(A\right)_{j-1}, y_v \leq DTr_{v \rightarrow A} \enspace.
  \end{equation*}
\end{proof}
