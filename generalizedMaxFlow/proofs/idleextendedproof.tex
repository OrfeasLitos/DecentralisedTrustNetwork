\begin{proof}
  We know that all direct trusts are finite. Combining this with the fact that $\forall v \in N^{-}\left(A\right),
  \gamma_{\left(v, A\right)} \rightarrow 0$ and that $Dmg_A \geq 0$, we deduce that the right part of
  (\ref{extendedstrategyequation}) is always equal to 0. In order for the left part of (\ref{extendedstrategyequation}) to be
  0, it must hold that $\forall v \in N^{-}\left(A\right), y_v = 0$, or equivalently that player $A$ will not steal any value
  from any player that directly trusts her. This means that player $A$ passes her turn, or equivalently that follows the Idle
  strategy.
\end{proof}
