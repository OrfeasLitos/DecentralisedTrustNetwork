\section{Introduction}
  In our previous work, we presented three distinct strategies for the players: the Idle, the Conservative and the Evil
  strategy. The process of determining the indirect trust from $Alice$ to $Bob$ involved assigning the Idle strategy to
  $Alice$, the Evil strategy to $Bob$ and the Conservative strategy to all other players. The indirect trust from $Alice$ to
  $Bob$ would then be the worst case scenario for $Alice$ when $Bob$ initiates a "chain reaction" of steal actions. This value
  was proven to be equal to the maximum flow from $Alice$ to $Bob$. Consider however the two following cases:

  \subimport{generalizedMaxFlow/figures/}{fewhops.tikz}

  \subimport{generalizedMaxFlow/figures/}{manyhops.tikz}

  One could argue that intuitively it should be $Tr_{\mathcal{G}_1, A \rightarrow B} > Tr_{\mathcal{G}_2, A \rightarrow B}$,
  since the longer chain of players connecting A and B in $\mathcal{G}_2$ introduces more uncertainty as to whether B is
  trustworthy. Nevertheless, according to our prior approach, it is $Tr_{\mathcal{G}_1, A \rightarrow B} = Tr_{\mathcal{G}_2,
  A \rightarrow B}$ since $maxFlow_{\mathcal{G}_1}\left(A, B\right) = maxFlow_{\mathcal{G}_2}\left(A, B\right)$.

  To mitigate this problem, we introduce a generalization of the previous approach that can handle these cases more
  robustly. The mechanism that we propose is analogous to an attenuation factor that accounts for the number of hops, but is
  better suited for the ambience of maximum flow. Each edge $e = \left(Alice, Bob\right) \in \mathcal{E}$ of the graph is
  supplemented with an additional number called \textit{loss factor}, which intuitively represents the "leakage" ratio on this
  edge, or the percentage of the damage incurred by $Bob$ that is carried over to $Alice$ through this edge, in case he is
  stolen some funds. The player who initiates the maxFlow calculation is the one that should specify the loss factors,
  according to her beliefs about the other players.
