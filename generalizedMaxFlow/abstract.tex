  Previous versions of Trust is Risk present the Conservative and the Idle strategy as distinct and unrelated. This work is an
  attempt to generalize this idea into a continuous spectrum of strategies, the two ends of which correspond to the two
  previously defined strategies. Prior to querying the system for an indirect trust towards Bob, Alice can attribute a specific
  expected strategy to each one of the participating players, or even fine-tune the response of each player to a steal action
  from each one of the players she directly trusts. The system then executes the generalized MaxFlow \cite{genmaxflow} to
  determine the indirect trust from Alice to Bob, given the specified strategies of the rest of the players.
