\subsection{Creators and Consumers}
  The last type of game described here consists of two categories of players: Creators and consumers. Creators generate
  shareable products as long as they have sufficient incoming direct trust. Consumers do not have to pay to obtain the
  products; as a matter of fact, any product can be accessed as long as some baseline. Consumers collectively fund the
  creators. We may think of creators as artists, researchers, programmers, journalists or other occupations that generate
  content which can then be easily distributed and shared.
