\subsection{$||\delta_i||_{\infty}$ minimizer}
  Naive algorithms result in $c'_i \leq x_i$, thus according to the Invariability Theorem (\ref{invariability}),
  $||\delta_i||_1$ is invariable for any of the possible results $C'$ of these algorithms and the resulting norms are not
  necessarily the minimum possible. The following algorithm concentrates on finding a configuration $C'$ that achieves $F' = F
  - V$ while minimizing the $||\delta_i||_\infty$ norm.

  Since trust should be considered as a continuous unit and binary search bisects the interval containing the solution
  on each recursive call, inclusion of the $\epsilon$-parameters in \texttt{BinSearch} is necessary for the algorithm to
  complete in a finite number of steps.

  Let $\delta \in \left[0, \max\limits_{1 \leq i \leq n}{\{c_i\}}\right]$. Furthermore, let $C'$ such that $\forall i \in
  \left[n\right], c'_i = \max{\left(0, c_i - \delta\right)}$. We define $maxFlow\left(\delta\right) =
  maxFlow_{\mathcal{G}'}\left(A, B\right) = F'$ and $MaxFlow\left(\delta\right) = X'$. Conventions similar to $F$, $X$ and $C$
  hold for $F'$, $X'$ and $\delta$ as far as subscripts are concerned.

  From the previous lemma we deduce that, given a $V \in \left(0, F\right)$, if we determine a $\delta$ such that
  $maxFlow\left(\delta\right) = F - V$, this $\delta$ is unique. Furthermore,
  \begin{equation*}
    ||\delta_i||_\infty = \max\limits_{1 \leq i \leq n}{\delta_i} = \max\limits_{1 \leq i \leq n}{\left(c_i - c'_i\right)} =
    \max\limits_{1 \leq i \leq n}{\left(c_i - \max{\left(0, c_i - \delta\right)}\right)} = \delta \enspace.
  \end{equation*}
  It is proven that the two algorithms work as expected, that is an invocation of \texttt{dinfmin} with valid inputs returns a
  capacity $C'$ that yields the desired $maxFlow$ and minimizes $||\delta_i||_\infty$. The complexity of \texttt{BinSearch} is
  $O\left(\left(maxFlow + n\right)\log_2\left(\frac{top - bot}{\epsilon_1 + \epsilon_2}\right)\right)$ and the complexity of
  \texttt{dinfmin} is $O\left(\left(maxFlow + n\right)\log_2\left(\frac{\delta_{max}}{\epsilon_1 + \epsilon_2}\right)\right)$.
