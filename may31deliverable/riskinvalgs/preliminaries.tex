  Until now $MaxFlow$ has been viewed purely as an algorithm. This algorithm is not guaranteed to always return the same
  flow configuration when executed muliple times on the same graph. However, the corresponding flow value, $maxFlow$, is
  always the same. Thus $maxFlow$ can be also viewed as a function from a matrix of capacities to a non-negative real number.
  Under this perspective, we prove the following theorem. Let $\mathcal{C}$ be the family of all capacity matrices
  $C = [c_{vw}]_{\mathcal{V} \times \mathcal{V}}$.
