\subsection{Naive Algorithms}
  Here we show three naive algorithms for calculating the new capacities that make use of the Trust Transfer
  corollary~(\ref{trusttransfer}). To prove the correctness of the algorithms, it suffices to prove that
  \begin{equation}
  \label{naive:req1}
     \forall i \in [n], c'_i \leq x_i \mbox{ and}
  \end{equation}
  \begin{equation}
  \label{naive:req2}
     \sum\limits_{i=1}^{n}c'_i = F - V \enspace.
  \end{equation}
  Due to the nature of these algorithms, the only inputs necessary are the initial flows $x_i$, the number of $A$'s neighbours
  $n$ and the desired flow reduction $V$. Proofs of correctness and complexity can be found in the Appendix.

  \subimport{common/algorithms/}{fcfscode.tex}

  The previous algorithm nullifies all outgoing trust to one player after the other in the order they are given in the input,
  until the desired indirect trust is achieved. The complexity of this algorithm is $O\left(n\right)$.

  \subimport{common/algorithms/}{abscode.tex}

  This algorithm finds a \texttt{reduction} value such that the configuration $\forall i \in \left[n\right], c'_i =
  \max{\left(0, x_i - \mbox{\texttt{reduction}}\right)}$ achieves the desired flow.

  The function \texttt{preprocess(}$x_i$\texttt{)} returns a data structure \texttt{X} containing the set of flows
  $\left(x_i\right)$, such that the corresponding function \texttt{popMin(X)} is able to repeatedly return a tuple
  consisiting of the index of the minimum element and a new data structure missing exactly the minimum element.
  Examples of such pairs of functions are:
  \begin{equation*}
  \begin{gathered}
    \begin{cases}
      \texttt{preprocess = quickSort} \\
      \texttt{popMin = (}x_1\texttt{, X}\setminus \{x_1\}\texttt{)}
    \end{cases}
    \mbox{ and} \\
    \begin{cases}
      \texttt{preprocess = FibonacciHeap} \\
      \texttt{popMin = (find-min(X),delete-min(X))}
    \end{cases} \enspace.
  \end{gathered}
  \end{equation*}
  In the general case, the complexity of the algorithm \texttt{abs} is proven to be
  $O\left(preprocess\right) + O\left(n\right)O\left(popMin\right)$. In both specific cases, the complexity is
  $O\left(n\log{n}\right)$. This algorithm also minimizes the $||\Delta_i||_\infty$ norm for the specific set of old flows
  $x_i$ given as input. A proof of this fact can be found in the Appendix.

  \subimport{common/algorithms/}{propcode.tex}
  This algorithm reduces all outgoing direct trust proportionally in such a way that the desired flow is achieved. The
  complexity of this algorithm is proven to be $O\left(n\right)$.
