\subsection{Degree of Connectedness}
  We would like to have a measure of how well connected is the graph. A network with a lot of disconnected cliques should
  score lower than a loosely connected network. This measure can be expressed as the expected indirect trust, defined as
  follows:
  \begin{gather*}
    E\left[Tr_{A \rightarrow B}\right] \enspace, \\
    \mbox{where } A, B \overset{\$}{\leftarrow} \mathcal{V} \enspace.
  \end{gather*}
  In cases where some players are irrelevant or Sybil, it may be useful to measure the expected indirect trust with respect to
  a subset of the players, namely $\mathcal{V}' \subset \mathcal{V}$. We then define $\mathcal{G}'$ as the induced subgraph
  $\mathcal{G} \setminus \left(\mathcal{V} \setminus \mathcal{V}'\right)$ and the expected indirect trust with respect to
  $\mathcal{V}'$ as
  \begin{gather*}
    E\left[Tr_{\mathcal{G}', A \rightarrow B}\right] \enspace, \\
    \mbox{where } A, B \overset{\$}{\leftarrow} \mathcal{V}' \enspace.
  \end{gather*}
