\subsection{Degree of Connectedness}
  We would like to have a measure of how well connected is the graph. A network with a lot of disconnected cliques should
  score lower than a loosely connected network. This measure can be expressed as the expected indirect trust, defined
  incrementally as follows:
  \begin{align*}
    Tr(A) = \sum\limits_{B \in \mathcal{V} \setminus \{A\}}Tr_{A \rightarrow B} && \mbox{ (Total indirect trust for player
    }A\mbox{)} \\
    ETr\left(A\right) = \frac{Tr(A)}{|\mathcal{V} \setminus \{A\}|} = \frac{Tr(A)}{|\mathcal{V}| - 1} && \mbox{ (Expected
    indirect trust for player }A\mbox{)} \\
    ETr = \frac{1}{|\mathcal{V}|}\sum\limits_{A \in \mathcal{V}}ETr\left(A\right) && \mbox{ (Expected indirect trust)}
  \end{align*}
