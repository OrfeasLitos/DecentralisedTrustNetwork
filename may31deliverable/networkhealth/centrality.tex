\subsection{Centrality}
  Another important measure is the network centrality. Intuitively, a network that resembles a mesh is preferable over a
  network with a central hub that acts as an intermediary between all other pairs of nodes. This is because in the latter case
  Trust Is Risk does not offer any realistic improvement over the existing centralized marketplaces model (e.g. ebay).
  Nevertheless, the expected indirect trust measure is not always able to distinguish between the two. We thus propose here
  some different measures to that end.
  
  \subsubsection{Degree Centrality} \ \\

    One possible approach is the degree centrality \cite{freeman}, that can be broken down as in-degree and out-degree
    centrality. We first define the node in-degree centrality.
    \begin{align*}
      C^d_{in}\left(A\right) = \sum\limits_{B \in \mathcal{V} \setminus \{A\}}DTr_{B \rightarrow A}\footnotemark && \mbox{
      (Node in-degree centrality)}
    \end{align*}
    \footnotetext{Maybe indirect trust is more intuitive here than direct trust.}
    Let $A^*$ be the player with the maximum centrality: $A^* = \argmax\limits_{A \in \mathcal{V}}C^d_{in}\left(A\right)$. The
    network in-degree centrality is defined as:
    \begin{align*}
      C^d_{in} = \sum\limits_{A \in \mathcal{V}}\left(C^d_{in}\left(A^*\right) - C^d_{in}\left(A\right)\right) && \mbox{
      (Network in-degree centrality)}
    \end{align*}
    Similarly, for the out-degree centrality we have:
    \addtocounter{footnote}{-1}
    \begin{align*}
      C^d_{out}\left(A\right) = \sum\limits_{B \in \mathcal{V} \setminus \{A\}}DTr_{A \rightarrow B}\footnotemark && \mbox{
      (Node out-degree centrality)}
    \end{align*}
    Let $A^* = \argmax\limits_{A \in \mathcal{V}}C^d_{out}\left(A\right)$. The network out-degree centrality is:
    \begin{align*}
      C^d_{out} = \sum\limits_{A \in \mathcal{V}}\left(C^d_{out}\left(A^*\right) - C^d_{out}\left(A\right)\right) && \mbox{
      (Network out-degree centrality)}
    \end{align*}

    A problem of these centrality measures is that their unit is the currency used (i.e. Bitcoin) and thus may not always have
    an intuitive meaning. We would thus like to have a measure of \textit{centralization} that has no units and can take
    values in the interval $\left[0,1\right]$, with 0 corresponding to a network of no centralization (all nodes are equal,
    e.g.  cycle) and 1 to a network with the maximum centralization possible (there is one central vital node for all, e.g.
    star). A centralization measure that achieves this target is proposed in \cite{freeman}. Here we use the following
    modified form. For a graph $\mathcal{G}$, the in- and out-centralization are defined as:
    \begin{align*}
      Cn^d_{in} &= \frac{C^d_{in}}{\max C^d_{in}} && \mbox{ (in-degree centralization)} \\
      Cn^d_{out} &= \frac{C^d_{out}}{\max C^d_{out}} && \mbox{ (out-degree centralization)} \enspace,
    \end{align*}
    where $\max C^d_{in}$ is defined as the maximum in-degree centrality over all networks with the same number of nodes for
    which the maximum direct\footnote{Maybe indirect trust is more intuitive here than direct trust.} trust is equal to the
    maximum \addtocounter{footnote}{-1}direct\footnotemark \ trust of $\mathcal{G}$; $\max C^d_{out}$ is defined equivalently.

  \subsubsection{maxFlow Centrality} \ \\

    An alternative measure of centrality for a player $A \in \mathcal{V}$ of a network $\mathcal{G}$ can be defined as the
    impact that the removal of $A$ would have on the indirect trust between the rest of the players. More specifically, let
    $\mathcal{G}' = \mathcal{G} \setminus \{A\}$. Then it is:
    \begin{align*}
      C^{mF}\left(A\right) = \sum\limits_{B,C \in \mathcal{V}'}\left(Tr_{\mathcal{G}, B \rightarrow C} - Tr_{\mathcal{G}', B
      \rightarrow C}\right) && \mbox{ (Node maxFlow centrality)} \enspace.
    \end{align*}
    We can now follow the same steps as previously for the relevant network definitions. Let $A^* = \argmax\limits_{A \in
    \mathcal{V}}C^{mF}\left(A\right)$. Then the network maxFlow centrality is:
    \begin{align*}
      C^{mF} = \sum\limits_{A \in \mathcal{V}}\left(C^{mF}\left(A^*\right) - C^{mF}\left(A\right)\right) && \mbox{ (Network
      maxFlow centrality)}
    \end{align*}
    and the centralization:
    \begin{align*}
      Cn^{mF} = \frac{C^{mF}}{\max C^{mF}} && \mbox{ (Network maxFlow centralization)} \enspace,
    \end{align*}
    where $\max C^{mF}$ is the maximum centrality over all networks with the same number of nodes for which the maximum
    direct\footnote{Maybe indirect trust is more intuitive here than direct trust.} trust is equal to the maximum
    \addtocounter{footnote}{-1} direct\footnotemark \ trust of $\mathcal{G}$.
