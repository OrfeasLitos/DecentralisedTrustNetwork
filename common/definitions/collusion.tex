\begin{definition}[Collusion]
  Let $\mathcal{G}$ be a game graph. Let $\mathcal{B} \subset \mathcal{V}$ be a corrupted set and $\mathcal{C} \subset
  \mathcal{V}$ be a Sybil set. The tuple $\left(\mathcal{B}, \mathcal{C}\right)$ is called collusion and is controlled by Eve.
  From a game theoretic point of view, players $\mathcal{V} \setminus (\mathcal{B} \cup \mathcal{C})$ perceive the collusion
  as independent players with a distinct strategy each, whereas in reality they are all subject to a single strategy dictated
  by Eve.
