\begin{definition}[Collusion]
   Let $\mathcal{G}$ be a game graph. Let $\mathcal{B} \subset \mathcal{V}$ be a corrupted set and $\mathcal{C} \subset
   \mathcal{V}$ be a Sybil set, both controlled by Eve. The tuple $\left(\mathcal{B}, \mathcal{C}\right)$ is called a
   collusion and is entirely controlled by a single entity in the physical world. From a game theoretic point of view,
   players $\mathcal{V} \setminus (\mathcal{B} \cup \mathcal{C})$ perceive the collusion as independent players with a
   distinct strategy each, whereas in reality they are all subject to a single strategy dictated by the controlling
   entity, Eve.
