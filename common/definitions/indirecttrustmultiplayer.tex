\begin{definition}[Indirect Trust to Multiple Players]
  Indirect trust from player $A$ to a set of players, $S \subset \mathcal{V}$ is defined as the maximum possible value that
  can be stolen from $A$ if all players in $S$ are evil, $A$ is idle and everyone else ($\mathcal{V} \setminus \left(S \cup
  \{A\}\right)$) is conservative.  Formally, let $choices$ be the different actions between which the conservative players
  choose, then
  \begin{equation}
     Tr_{A \rightarrow S, j} = \max\limits_{j' : j' > j, choices}{\left[out_{A,j} - out_{A,j'}\right]} \enspace.
  \end{equation}
\end{definition}
