\begin{definition}[Sybil Set]
   Let $\mathcal{G}$ be a game graph. Since participation in the network does not require any kind of registration, Eve
   can create any number of players. We will call the set of these players $\mathcal{C}$, or Sybil set. Moreover, Eve
   can arbitrarily set the direct trusts of any player in $\mathcal{C}$ to any player and can also steal all
   incoming direct trust to players in $\mathcal{C}$. However, players $\mathcal{C}$ can be directly trusted only by
   players $\mathcal{B} \cup \mathcal{C}$ but not by players $\mathcal{V} \setminus (\mathcal{B} \cup \mathcal{C})$,
   where $\mathcal{B}$ is a set of players corrupted by Eve.
