\begin{definition}[Sybil Set]
  Let $\mathcal{G}$ be a game graph. Participation does not require registration, so Eve can create unlimited players. We call
  the set of these players $\mathcal{C}$, or Sybil set. Moreover, Eve controls their direct and indirect trusts with any
  player. However, players $\mathcal{C}$ can be directly trusted only by players $\mathcal{B} \cup \mathcal{C}$ but not by
  players $\mathcal{V} \setminus (\mathcal{B} \cup \mathcal{C})$, where $\mathcal{B}$ is the corrupted set.
\end{definition}
