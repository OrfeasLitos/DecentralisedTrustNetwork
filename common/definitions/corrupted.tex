\begin{definition}[Corrupted Set]
  Let $\mathcal{G}$ be a game graph and let Eve have a set of players $\mathcal{B} \subset \mathcal{V}$ corrupted, so
  that she fully controls their outgoing and incoming direct trusts with any player in $\mathcal{V}$. We call this the
  corrupted set. The players $\mathcal{B}$ are considered legitimate before the corruption, thus they may be directly trusted
  by any player in $\mathcal{V}$.
\end{definition}
