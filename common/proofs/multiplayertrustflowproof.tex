\begin{proof}
  If $T$ chooses the evil strategy and all players in $S$ play according to the conservative strategy, they will have
  to steal all their incoming direct trust since they have suffered an infinite loss, thus they will act in a way
  identical to following the evil strategy as far as $MaxFlow$ is concerned. The theorem follows thus from the Trust
  Flow theorem.
%  \begin{equation}
%     \forall A \in \mathcal{V} \setminus S, Tr_{A \rightarrow T} = maxFlow\left(A, T\right) = Tr_{A \rightarrow S}
%     \enspace.
%  \end{equation}
\end{proof}
