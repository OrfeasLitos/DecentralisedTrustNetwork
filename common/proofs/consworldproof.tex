\begin{proof}
   Let $\mathcal{H}$ be the game history where all players are conservative and suppose there are some
   $Steal\left(\right)$ actions taking place. Then let $\mathcal{H}'$ be the subsequence of turns each containing at
   least one $Steal\left(\right)$ action. This subsequence is evidently nonempty, thus it must have a first element. The
   player corresponding to that turn, $A$, has chosen a $Steal\left(\right)$ action and no previous player has chosen
   such an action. However, player $A$ follows the conservative strategy, which is a contradiction.
\end{proof}
