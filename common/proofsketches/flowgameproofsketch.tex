    \begin{proofsketch}
       The desired execution of \texttt{TransitiveGame()} will contain all flows from the $MaxFlow\left(A, E\right)$ as
       equivalent $Steal\left(\right)$ actions. The players will play in turns, moving from $E$ back to $A$. Each player will
       steal from his predecessors as much as was stolen from her. The flows and the conservative strategy share the property
       that the total input is equal to the total output.
