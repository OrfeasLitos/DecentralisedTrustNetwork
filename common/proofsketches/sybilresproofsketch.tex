\begin{proofsketch}
  The incoming direct trust to $\mathcal{B} \cup \mathcal{C}$ cannot be higher than the incoming direct trust to
  $\mathcal{B}$ since $\mathcal{C}$ has no incoming direct trust from
  $\mathcal{V} \setminus \left(\mathcal{B} \cup \mathcal{C}\right)$. %players outside the collusion.
