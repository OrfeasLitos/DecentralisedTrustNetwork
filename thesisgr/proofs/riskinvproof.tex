\begin{proof}
  The two graphs $\mathcal{G}'$ and $\mathcal{G}''$ differ only on the weight of the edge $\left(A, B\right)$, which is
  larger by $l$ in $\mathcal{G}''$. Thus the two $MaxFlow$s will choose the same flow, except for $\left(A, B\right)$,
  where it will be $x''_{AB} = x'_{AB} + l$.
\end{proof}
