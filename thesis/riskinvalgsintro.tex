We will now focus our discussion on the act of a riskless purchase. According to the Risk Invariance theorem (\ref{riskinv}),
if $Alice$ wants to buy something that costs $l$ from the vendor $Bob$, she should first find a new distribution of her
outgoing direct trust such that $maxFlow'\left(A, B\right) = maxFlow\left(A, B\right) - l$ and then entrust $l$ to $Bob$.
The theorem then ensures that the initial risk is equal to the final. In the following section we discuss several algorithms
that calculate possible new distributions for $Alice$'s outgoing trust.

Let $A \in \mathcal{V}$ source, $B \in \mathcal{V}$ sink. For the following, we suppose that $Turn_{j-1}$ has just finished
and $A = Player\left(j\right)$ is currently deciding $Turn_j$. We use the following notation:
\begin{align*}
  C \mbox{ capacity configuration with } c_{Av} &= DTr_{A \rightarrow v, j-1} \\
  C' \mbox{ capacity configuration with } c'_{Av} &= DTr_{A \rightarrow v, j}
\end{align*}

We will use the following notation for clarity:
\begin{equation*}
\begin{gathered}
  \begin{cases}
    X = MaxFlow_{\mathcal{G}_{j-1}}\left(A, B\right) \\
    X' = MaxFlow_{\mathcal{G}_j}\left(A, B\right)
  \end{cases}, \mbox{ for some } MaxFlow \mbox{ execution} \\
  \begin{cases}
    F = maxFlow_{\mathcal{G}_{j-1}}\left(A, B\right) \\
    F' = maxFlow_{\mathcal{G}_j}\left(A, B\right)
  \end{cases}
\end{gathered}
\end{equation*}
Any subscripts or superscripts applied to $X$ and $F$ refer to the capacity configuration with the exact same subscripts and
superscripts.

Furthermore, we suppose an arbitrary ordering of the members of $N^{+}\left(A\right)$. We set $n = |N^{+}\left(A\right)|$.
Thus
\begin{equation*}
  N^{+}\left(A\right) = \{v_1, ..., v_n\}
\end{equation*}
We use these subscripts to refer to the respective capacities (a.k.a. direct trusts) and flows. Thus
\begin{equation*}
  \begin{array}{l}
    x_i = x_{Av_i} \enspace, \\
    c_i = c_{Av_i} \enspace,
  \end{array}
  \mbox{ where } i \in [n]
\end{equation*}
