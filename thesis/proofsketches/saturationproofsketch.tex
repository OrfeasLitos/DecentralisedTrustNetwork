\begin{proofsketch}
  A new valid flow $Y$ for turn $j - 1$ can be created starting with $X$ by reducing the flows along $\left(v_i, ...,
  B\right)$ paths until all $\left(A, v_i\right)$ flows can be reduced to $c'_i$. The flow $Y$ is then valid for the
  capacities of turn $j$ and, since all capacities $c'_i$ are saturated, $Y$ is furthermore a maximum flow in $\mathcal{G}_j$.
