Note that we choose to calculate the complexity of the \texttt{length()} function as $O\left(n\right)$. Whereas this
complexity is implementation-dependent, even with the most naive approaches it cannot be higher than $O\left(n\right)$,
thus we use this worst-case complexity in our analysis to cover all cases. This approach is implicitly used in all
subsequent complexity analyses, but since all complexities are greater than $O\left(n\right)$, this approach does not
influence them.

We will now prove that \texttt{BinSearch} returns the desired $\delta^*$ when we provide it with an appropriate interval as
input.
