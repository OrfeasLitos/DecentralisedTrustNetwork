\section{Introduction}
  Modern online marketplaces can be roughly categorized as centralized and decentralized.
  Two major examples of each category are \href{http://www.ebay.com}{ebay} and \href{https://openbazaar.org/}{OpenBazaar}.
  The common denominator of established online marketplaces is that the reputation of each vendor and client is either
  expressed in the form of stars and user-generated reviews that are viewable by the whole network, or not expressed at
  all inside the marketplace and instead is entirely built on word-of-mouth or other out-of-band means.

  The goal of "Trust Is Risk" is to offer a decentralized marketplace where the trust each user gives to the rest of the users
  is quantifiable, measurable and expressable in monetary terms. The central concept used throughout this paper is that trust
  is equivalent to risk, or the proposition that $Alice$'s \textit{trust} to another user $Bob$ is defined to be the
  \textit{maximum sum of money} that $Alice$ can lose when $Bob$ is free to choose any strategy he wants. To flesh out this
  concept, we will use \textit{lines of credit} as proposed by Washington Sanchez \cite{loc}, not to be confused with the
  synonymous financial product. Joining the network will be done by explicitly entrusting a certain amount of money to another
  user, say $Bob$. If $Bob$ has already entrusted an amount of money to a third user, $Charlie$, then we indirectly trust
  $Charlie$ since if the latter wished to play unfairly, he could have already stolen the money entrusted to him by $Bob$.
  Thus we can engage in economic interaction with $Charlie$. The currency used is Bitcoin \cite{bitcoin}.

  We thus propose a new kind of wallet where coins are not stored locally, but are placed in 1-of-2 multisigs, a bitcoin
  construction that permits any one of two pre-designated users to spend the coins contained therein \cite{masteringbitcoin}.
  We will use the notation 1/$\{Alice, Bob\}$ to represent a 1-of-2 multisig that can be spent by either $Alice$ or $Bob$.

  Our approach changes the user experience in a subtle but drastic way. A user no more has to base her trust towards a store
  on stars or ratings which are not expressed in financial units. She can simply consult her wallet to decide whether the
  store is trustworthy and, if so, up to what value, denominated in bitcoin. This system works as follows: Initially $Alice$
  migrates her funds from her private bitcoin wallet to 1-of-2 multisig addresses shared with friends she comfortably trusts.
  We call this direct trust. Our system is agnostic to the means players use to determine who is trustworthy for these direct
  1-of-2 deposits. One novelty of our system is that this dubious kind of trust is confined to the direct neighbourhood of
  each player; indirect trust towards unknown users is calculated by a deterministic algorithm.  For comparison, systems with
  global ratings do not distinguish between neighbours and other users, thus offering dubious trust indications for all users.

  Suppose that $Alice$ is viewing the item listings of vendor $Charlie$. Instead of $Charlie$'s stars, $Alice$ will see a
  positive value that is calculated by her wallet and represents the maximum monetary value that $Alice$ can safely use to
  complete a purchase from $Charlie$. We examine exactly how this value, known as indirect trust, is calculated in Trust Flow
  theorem~\ref{trustflow}. It is important to note here that indirect trust to a specific user is not global but subjective;
  each user views a personalized indirect trust based on the network topology. The indirect trust reported by our system
  maintains the following desired security property: If $Alice$ makes a purchase from $Charlie$, then she is exposed to no
  more risk than she was already taking willingly. The existing willing risk is exactly that which $Alice$ was taking by
  sharing her coins with her trusted friends. We prove this result in the Risk Invariance theorem~\ref{riskinv}. Obviously it
  will not be safe for $Alice$ to buy anything from $Charlie$ or any other vendor if she has entrusted no value to any other
  user.

  We see that in Trust Is Risk the money is not invested at the time of the purchase and directly to the vendor, but at an
  earlier point in time and only to parties that are trustworthy for out of band reasons. The fact that this system can
  function in a completely decentralized fashion will become clear in the following sections. We prove this result in the
  Sybil Resilience theorem~\ref{sybil}.

  There are several incentives for a user to join this network. First of all, she can have access to a store that is
  otherwise inaccessible. Moreover, two friends can formalize their mutual trust by entrusting the same amount to each
  other. A large company that casually subcontracts other companies to complete various tasks can express its trust
  towards them using this method. A government can choose to entrust its citizens with money and confront them using a
  corresponding legal arsenal if they make irresponsible use of this trust. A bank can provide loans as outgoing and
  manage savings as incoming trust and thus has a unique opportunity of expressing in a formal and absolute way its
  credence by publishing its incoming and outgoing trust. Last but not least, the network can be viewed as a possible
  field for investment and speculation since it constitutes a completely new area for financial activity.

  It is worth noting that the same physical person can maintain multiple pseudonymous identities in the same trust network
  and that multiple independent trust networks for different purposes can coexist. On the other hand, the same
  pseudonymous identity can be used to establish trust in different contexts.
