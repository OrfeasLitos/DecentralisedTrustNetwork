\begin{proof}[Complexity of algorithm fcfs]
   Since $i$ is incremented by 1 on every iteration of the \texttt{while} loop (line~\ref{fcfs:iinc}) and $i < n+1$ at the
   end of the execution, the complexity of the \texttt{while} loop is $O(n)$ in the worst case. The complexity of
   lines~\ref{fcfs:ifinputvalid} -~\ref{fcfs:fcurinit} and~\ref{fcfs:iinit} is $O(1)$ and the complexity of
   lines~\ref{fcfs:finit},~\ref{fcfs:forcapinit} -~\ref{fcfs:capinit} and~\ref{fcfs:return} is $O(n)$, thus the total
   complexity of algorithm \ref{fcfs} is $O(n)$.
\end{proof}
