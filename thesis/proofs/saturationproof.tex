\begin{proof}
   $\forall i \in [n], x_i' > u_i'$ is impossible because a flow cannot be higher than its 
   corresponding capacity. Thus $\forall i \in [n], x_i' \leq u_i'$. (1) \\ 
   In the initial configuration of $u_i$ and according to the flow problem setting, a combination of flows 
   $y_i$ such that $\forall i \in [n], y_i = u_i'$ is a valid, albeit not necessarily maximum, 
   configuration with a flow $\sum\limits_{i=1}^{n}y_i$. Suppose that $\exists k \in [n] : x_k' 
   < u_k'$ as calculated by the maxFlow algorithm with the new direct trusts, $u_i'$. Then for the new 
   maxFlow $F'$ it holds that $F' = \sum\limits_{i=1}^{n}x_i' < \sum\limits_{i=1}^{n}y_i$ since $x_k' < y_k$ 
   and (1) which is impossible because the configuration $\forall i \in [n], x_i' = y_i$ is valid since  
   $\forall i \in [n], y_i = u_i'$ and also has a higher flow, thus the maxFlow algorithm will 
   prefer the configuration with the higher flow. Thus we deduce that $\forall i \in [n], x_i' = u_i'$.
