\begin{proof}[Proof of correctness of abs] \
  We will first show that $\forall i \in [n], c'_i \leq x_i$, as per the requirement (\ref{naive:req1}). From
  line~\ref{abs:setcap}, we see that it suffices to prove that $\texttt{reduction} \geq 0$. On line~\ref{abs:reductioninit},
  \texttt{reduction} is initialized to 0. On line~\ref{abs:setreduction}, \texttt{reduction} is set to $x_i$, which is always
  a non-negative value. The last line where \texttt{reduction} is modified is~\ref{abs:setlastreduction}.

  We will now show that $\sum\limits_{i=1}^nc'_i = F - V$.
\end{proof}
