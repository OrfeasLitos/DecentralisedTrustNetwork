\begin{proof}[Complexity of algorithm \ref{abs}]
   In the worst case scenario, each time we iterate over all capacities only the last non-zero capacity will become zero
   and every non-zero capacity must be recalculated. This means that every $n$ steps exactly 1 capacity becomes zero
   and eventually all capacities (maybe except for one) become zero. Thus we need $O(n^2)$ steps in the worst case.
\end{proof}
