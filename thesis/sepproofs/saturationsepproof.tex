\begin{sepproof}{Proof of Theorem \ref{saturation}: Saturation} \ \\
  From the flow definition we know that
  \begin{equation}
  \label{saturation:flowleqcap}
    \forall i \in [n], x'_i \leq c'_i \enspace.
  \end{equation}
  We will show constructively that in turn $j-1$, there exists some valid flow $Y$ such that
  \begin{equation*}
    \forall i \in [n], y_i = c'_i
  \end{equation*}
  Here the algorithm that calculates the desired flow can be seen.

  \subimport{../algorithms/}{saturationcode.tex}

  Since $Y$ is valid for $\mathcal{G}_{j-1}$ and all the flows outgoing from $A$ are compatible with the capacities of
  $\mathcal{G}_j$, $Y$ is also a valid flow for $\mathcal{G}_j$. Furthermore, since all capacities $c'_i$ are saturated, there
  can be no more outgoing flow from $A$, thus $Y$ is a maximum flow in $\mathcal{G}_j$, or $Y = X'$.
\end{sepproof}
