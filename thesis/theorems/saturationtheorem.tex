\begin{theorem}[Saturation theorem] \ \\
   \label{saturation} 
   Let $s$ source, $n = |N^{+}(s)|, x_i, i \in [n]$, flows to $s$'s neighbours as calculated by the 
   maxFlow algorithm, $u_i'$ new direct trusts to the $n$ neighbours and $x_i'$ new flows to the neighbours 
   as calculated by the maxFlow algorithm with the new direct trusts, $u_i'$. It holds that 
   $\forall i \in [n], u_i' \leq x_i \Rightarrow x_i' = u_i'$.
