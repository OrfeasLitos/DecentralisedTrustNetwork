   \section{Evolution of Trust}

     We use $prev\left(j\right)$ and $next\left(j\right)$ to denote the previous and next turn respectively played by
     $Player(j)$. A formal definition is in the Appendix.

     Knowledge of the initial graph $\mathcal{G}_0$ and the history amount to full comprehension of the evolution of the
     game. Building on the example of figure \ref{fig:turn}, we can see the resulting graph when $D$ plays
     \begin{equation}
     \label{turnexample}
        Turn_1 = \{Steal\left(1, A\right), Add\left(4, C\right)\} \enspace.
     \end{equation}
     TrustIsRisk is controlled by an algorithm that chooses a player, receives the turn that
     this player wishes to play and, if this turn is valid, executes it. These steps are repeated indefinitely. We assume
     players are chosen in a way that, after her turn, a player will eventually play again later.
     \subimport{../common/algorithms/}{trustisriskgame.tex}
     \texttt{executeTurn()} checks the validity of \texttt{Turn} and substitutes it with an empty turn if invalid.
     Subsequently, it creates the new graph $\mathcal{G}_j$ and updates the history accordingly. For the routine code,
     see the Appendix.
