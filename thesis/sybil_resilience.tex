  \section{Sybil Resilience}
    One of the primary aims of this system is to mitigate the danger for Sybil attacks \cite{sybilattack} whilst maintaining
    fully decentralized autonomy.

    Here we extend the definition of indirect trust to many players.
    \subimport{common/definitions/}{indirecttrustmultiplayer.tex}
    We now extend Trust Flow theorem (\ref{trustflow}) to many players.
    \subimport{common/theorems/}{multiplayertrustflowtheorem.tex}
    \subimport{common/proofs/}{multiplayertrustflowproof.tex}
    We now define several useful notions to tackle the problem of Sybil attacks. Let Eve be a possible attacker.
    \subimport{common/definitions/}{corrupted.tex}
    \subimport{common/definitions/}{sybil.tex}
    \subimport{common/definitions/}{collusion.tex}
    \subimport{common/figures/}{collusion.tikz}
    \subimport{common/theorems/}{sybilrestheorem.tex}
    \subimport{common/proofsketches/}{sybilresproofsketch.tex}
    We have proven that controlling $|\mathcal{C}|$ is irrelevant for Eve, thus Sybil attacks are meaningless.

    We have successfully delivered our promise for a Sybil-resilient decentralized financial trust system with
    invariant risk for purchases.
