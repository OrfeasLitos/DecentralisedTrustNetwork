\begin{definition}[Turns]
   The game we are describing is turn-based. In each turn $j$ exactly one player $A \in \mathcal{V}, A =
   Player\left(j\right)$, chooses one or more actions from the following two kinds:

   \noindent \textit{\textbf{Steal($y_B$,$\:B$)}}: Steal value $y_B$ from $B \in N^{-}\left(A\right)_{j-1}$, where
   $0 \leq y_B \leq DTr_{B \rightarrow A, j-1}$. Then:
   \begin{equation*}
      DTr_{B \rightarrow A, j} = DTr_{B \rightarrow A, j-1} - y_B
   \end{equation*}
   \noindent \textit{\textbf{Add($y_B$,$\:B$)}}:
   Add value $y_B$ to $B \in \mathcal{V}$, where $-DTr_{A \rightarrow B, j-1} \leq y_B$. Then:
   \begin{equation*}
      DTr_{A \rightarrow B, j} = DTr_{A \rightarrow B, j-1} + y_B
   \end{equation*}
   When $y_B < 0$, we say that $A$ reduces her trust to $B$ by $-y_B$. When $y_B > 0$, we say that $A$ increases her
   trust to $B$ by $y_B$. If $DTr_{A \rightarrow B, j-1} = 0$, then we say that $A$ starts directly trusting $B$.
   If player $A$ chooses no action in her turn, we say that she passes her turn. Also, let $Y_{st}, Y_{add}$ be the
   total value to be stolen and added respectively by $A$ in her turn, $j$. For a turn to be feasible, it must hold that
   \begin{equation}
      Y_{add} - Y_{st} \leq Cap_{A, j-1} \enspace.
   \end{equation}
   The capital is updated in every turn:
   \begin{equation*}
      Cap_{A, j} = Cap_{A, j-1} + Y_{st} - Y_{add} \enspace.
   \end{equation*}

   Moreover, player $A$ is not allowed to choose two actions of the same kind against the same player in one turn.
   The set of actions the player makes in turn $j$ is denoted by $Turn_j$. The new graph that emerges by applying
   the actions on $\mathcal{G}_{j-1}$ is $\mathcal{G}_j$.
\end{definition}
