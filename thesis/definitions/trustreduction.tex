\begin{definition}[Trust Reduction]

  Trust Reduction on neighbour $i$ is defined as $\delta_i = c_i - c_i'$.

  Flow Reduction on neigbour $i$ is defined as $\Delta_i = x_i - c_i'$.

  We will also use the standard notation for 1-norm and $\infty$-norm:
  \begin{align*}
    ||\delta_i||_1 &= \sum\limits_{i = 1}^n\delta_i \\
    ||\delta_i||_\infty &= \max\limits_{1 \leq i \leq n}\delta_i
  \end{align*}
\end{definition}
